About me
======

Currently
------
I'm a master student majoring in mechanical engineering from [UM-SJTU Joint Institute](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). 
I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zijie Qu (屈子杰)](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/about/faculty-staff/faculty-directory/faculty-detail/32777/) of [Bio-inspired Fluid Mechanics Lab ](https://sites.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/zijie-qu/) from [UM-SJTU Joint Institute](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/).

Background
------
I obtained my bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from [UM-SJTU Joint Institute](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/).

Research Interest
------
I am interested in all kinds of biological phenomena in the microscopic world, and centered on the theme of experimental fluid mechanics, the topics covered include:
1. Macroscopic experiment of bacterial flagella interaction
2. Bacteria swimming – both individual swimming and collective motion
3. Microfluidics – design of new microfluidic channels and devices
