Currently
------
I'm a master student majoring in mechanical engineering from [UM-SJTU Joint Institute](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). 
I am very fortunate to be advised by [Prof. Zijie Qu (屈子杰)](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/about/faculty-staff/faculty-directory/faculty-detail/32777/) of [Bio-inspired Fluid Mechanics Lab ](https://sites.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/zijie-qu/) from [UM-SJTU Joint Institute](https://cs.pku.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/).

Background
------
I obtained my bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from [UM-SJTU Joint Institute](https://www.ji.sjtu.edu.cn/), [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/).

Research Interest
------
I am interested in all kinds of biological phenomena in the microscopic world, and centered on the theme of experimental fluid mechanics, the topics covered include:
1. Macroscopic experiment of bacterial flagella interaction
2. Bacteria swimming – both individual swimming and collective motion
3. Microfluidics – design of new microfluidic channels and devices

Macroscopic model of bacterial flagella interaction and propulsion generation
------
Limited by micron-sized experimental objects, systematic manipulation of bacteria is complex and often impossible. Therefore, our group proposes a macroscopic experimental facility that can measure propulsion force and observe the flagella interaction based on previous research.
The macroscopic experiment system is designed to achieve four functions: propulsion force measurement, two-camera-synchronization, 2 DOF motor platform, and macroscopic helix models with bionic hooks. Based on this experimental system, typical “bundle” phenomenon of helices are observed. Also, the propulsion force generated by helices will be directly recorded via sensors with high precision.

Real-Time 3D Digital Tracking Microscopy
------
To observe the swimming behavior of the cells, our group designed a 3D digital tracking microscope. It allows us to study the motility of individuals for a relatively long period (15 s on average) compared with more common stationary microscope stages.
The cells are observed using a Nikon Eclipse Ti2 Inverted Microscope with a CFI Plan Fluor 20XMI objective and PCO edge 5.5 sCMOS camera. A 2D translational stage (Prior) is used for tracking the cells in the 2D plane parallel to the glass slide. A piezo objective positioner (Physik Instrumente) is used to rapidly control the position of the focal plane in real time so that the cell always remains in the field of view. Images are acquired at 60 fps with a resolution of 640 pixels × 480 pixels. A real-time algorithm, written in C++ and OpenCV, detects the position (centroid) of a single cell in the image and moves the stage and objective to maintain the cell in focus and within the field of view.
