Education
======
* Master of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 2025 (Estimated)
* Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 2023

Research experience
======
* Jun 2024 - Present: Study on *Enterobacter* sp. SM3 swarming under Different Conditions
  * Verifying influences of gravity and solid boundary to bacterial swarming by monitoring the colony growth microscopically and microscopically, using self-developed imaging platform to record and quantitate and microscope
  * Analyzing characteristic velocity, length, and time scales for bacterial motion in different areas of the swarming colonies (edge, near-edge, far-edge) by using particle image velocimetry (PIV) and optical flow methods
  * (Estimated) Building a theoretical model to explain the growth of swarming colony affected by gravitation force and under solid surface constrain based on experimental results and analysis
  * Supervisors: Prof. Zijie Qu

* Mar 2024 - Present: Experimental Study on Microbial Movement under Interface Constraint
  * Applying a 3D real-time tracking microscope to track the swimming microorganism for long time (> 15s)
  * Measuring the swimming characteristics, including speed distribution, trajectory curvature, of smooth-swimming *E. coli* on near solid surfaces (glass slides) and semi-solid surfaces (non-nutrient agar of different concentration)
  * (Estimated) Building a theoretical model to explain the trends of ``pusher" type cells' attraction to softer surfaces
  * Supervisors: Prof. Zijie Qu

* Aug 2022 - Jun 2024: A Macroscopic Model of Bacterial Flagella Interaction and Propulsion Generation
  * Designed and Developed a multi-functional macroscopic experimental platform to test model bacterial flagella interaction and propulsion generation under different parameters including separation distance and phase difference
  * Observed the differences of individual contribution from each filament to total propulsion force when phase difference existed, and revealed hydrodynamic interactions reached maximum when phase difference equals to \pi and -\pi
  * Proposed a bacterial swimming model to explain the ``wobble" phenomenon in *E. coli* locomotion based on experimental results of unequal propulsion forces generated by individual filaments in a bundle
