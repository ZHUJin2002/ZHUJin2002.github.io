Education
======
* Master of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 2025 (Estimated)
* Bachelor of Engineering in Mechanical Engineering, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, 2023

Research experience
======
* Jun 2024 - Present: **Study on *Enterobacter* sp. SM3 swarming under Different Conditions**
  * Verifying influences of gravity and solid boundary to bacterial swarming by monitoring the colony growth microscopically and microscopically, using self-developed imaging platform to record and quantitate and microscope
  * Analyzing characteristic velocity, length, and time scales for bacterial motion in different areas of the swarming colonies (edge, near-edge, far-edge) by using particle image velocimetry (PIV) and optical flow methods
  * (Estimated) Building a theoretical model to explain the growth of swarming colony affected by gravitation force and under solid surface constrain based on experimental results and analysis
  * Supervisors: Prof. Zijie Qu

* Mar 2024 - Present: **Experimental Study on Microbial Movement under Interface Constraint**
  * Applying a 3D real-time tracking microscope to track the swimming microorganism for long time (> 15s)
  * Measuring the swimming characteristics, including speed distribution, trajectory curvature, of smooth-swimming *E. coli* on near solid surfaces (glass slides) and semi-solid surfaces (non-nutrient agar of different concentration)
  * (Estimated) Building a theoretical model to explain the trends of ``pusher" type cells' attraction to softer surfaces
  * Supervisors: Prof. Zijie Qu

* Aug 2022 - Jun 2024: **A Macroscopic Model of Bacterial Flagella Interaction and Propulsion Generation**
  * Designed and Developed a multi-functional macroscopic experimental platform to test model bacterial flagella interaction and propulsion generation under different parameters including separation distance and phase difference
  * Observed the differences of individual contribution from each filament to total propulsion force when phase difference existed, and revealed hydrodynamic interactions reached maximum when phase difference equals to $\pi$ and -$\pi$
  * Proposed a bacterial swimming model to explain the ``wobble" phenomenon in *E. coli* locomotion based on experimental results of unequal propulsion forces generated by individual filaments in a bundle
  * Supervisors: Prof. Zijie Qu and Prof. Gaojin Li
 
* Dec 2021 -Aug 2022: **Microfluidic Robot Powered by Electroosmosis-based Electrode Arrays**
  * Simulated liquid pumping with ac-voltages applied to asymmetric electrode pairs by COMSOL, and obtained optimal electrodes pair size ratio of 5:3 under $V_{pp} = 8$V and 3 kHz frequency with experiment verification
  * Achieved 3 $\mu$m/s swimming speed of a 1.8 mm*1.3 mm chip with 5 sets of 20-electrodes-array applying travelling-wave electroosmosis (TWEO) under $V_{pp} = 3$V and 4 kHz frequency in experiments based on simulation
  * Supervisors: Prof. Zijie Qu and Prof. Xuyang Lu
 
* Aug 2021 - Dec 2021: **Multi-material Direct Ink Writing 3D Printer Construction**
  * Designed the structure of a new easily-assembled DIW printing extruder that lower the cost by 30%
  * Investigated the impact of different infill density, infill patterns and surface density, on material properties of 3D-printed objects by optimizing traditional 3D printer G-code generating logic to three different methods
  * Supervisors: Prof. Jaehyung Ju
